            <p>My name is Isaac Black. I was born in Colorado City, Arizona. A fundamentalist LDS community on the border of Utah and Arizona. My early life was interesting and if you are curious I would be happy to discuss it. I have had many different jobs throughout my 53 years. Adult tricycle manufacturing, injection mold machining, plastic injection machine operation, CNC machining, cabinetmaking, concrete logs for gas fireplace manufacturing, plastic thermal forming operation, Concrete yard operation, truck driving, farm hand, bank processing, telephone tech support and customer service, boarding school counselor(non-professional), salad dressing manufacturing, bus driver, and now property inspector for insurance. I enjoy working with my hands and playing computer games. I also like to fish, explore in my ATV, and just enjoy the great outdoors.</p>

            <p>Bonners Ferry is located in the panhandle of Idaho. It's less than 30 miles to canada. The panhandle of Idaho is only about 25 miles wide from East to West. We have the mighty Kootenai river running through it. Lots of wilderness with many small lakes. It's a great place for outdoor activities</p>
